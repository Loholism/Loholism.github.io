      What is Loholism?
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Loholism is a peaceful Minecraft: Bedrock Edition<br />
      "religion" and clan based on the infamous LOH kit in 2b2tmcpe.org.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Currently, loholism just acts like a clan with events every now and then.

    <h3>
      Loholism: The Account of Creation
    </h3>
    <h4>
      In the beginning God created  the Earth  and the Warps.<br />
The earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the deep waters. <br /> And the Admins were hovering over the surface of the waters.<br />
Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.<br />
And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness.<br />
God called the light “day” and the darkness “night.”<br /> 
And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day in this server.<br />
 then god said jk bitçhes its afternoon forever and it rains sometimes now.<br />
 <br />
Then God said, “Let there be a border between Warp pvp and the rest of the world" and that is what happened.<br />
 God made four huge bedrock walls surrounding the pvp area where he wanted his server users also known as "players" to fight for "fun".<br />
 <br />
The land produced vegetation—all sorts of colorful flowers , and trees in all kinds of hard wood.<br />
God saw that it was good so he kept it.<br />
<br />
Then God said, "am too poor to get good server hardware" ,so he added a restart feature .<br />
<br />
To let his "thankful" players  know when the server is going to restart
      <br />
      ,he made one of his many computer slaves announce when the server is going to restart with a countdown to scare/warn players <br /> but when his slaves are asleep it just restarts with no warning.<br />
<br />
Then God said, “Let the waters swarm with fish and other life. Let the skies be filled with birds of every kind.”<br /> 
So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that scurries and swarms in the water, once again god said "jk lol"<br />
and pressed undo.<br /> 
<br />
Then God said, “Now that i made all this shít ,lemme add some players to torcher"<br />
and that marked the beginning of https://mcpedl.com/servers/2b2t-mcpe/<br />
which is where god begs for players so his server doesn't die.<br />
<br />
Then God blessed them and said, “My anticheat is shít so you ppl can fly and dupe lolololol"<br />
<br />
Then God said, “Look! I've brought you stacks of illegals to ruin the server cuz I'm a good owner #wap"<br />
    -A gift from God
    <br />
So the creation of the land and the Warps and everything in them was completed.<br />
all what was left to do is for God to send one of his trustful angels, who goes by the name of <br /> "Tim1" to be one of his players , God said that Tim is a special kind of an angel and that he's too good for heaven, so he sent him to earth.<br />
<br />
Tim saw good in the players of 2b2tmcpe and so he began working hard on making them a gift of appreciation.<br />
He thought long and hard.<br />
As he opened his chests of loot, "This is it" he said.<br />
an idea struck into Tim's mind which would single handedly change the future of 2b2tmcpe forever.<br />
He got his shulkers and tools, and a bunch of illegalls god gave him and started putting everything in place.<br />
"Its done , THE KIT IS FINNALLY DONE" He cheered.<br />
all that was left to do is choose and a suitable name and dupe the kit<br />
<br />
He brainstormed day and night, until he came up with the name "Loh kit" which stands for "Light of hope kit".<br />
<br />
"Now its time for duping" Tim mumbled, he prepared his blink shortcut button and joined with his friend <br /> and started duping, he stayed up for days working hard and after alot of pain and lag he got 4 double chests full of loh kits.<br />
<br />
Then he started giving new players (also known as "newfags") loh kits , and as expected they loved it.<br />
And before long , people from all around the server has known about the loh kit,and it was massively duped by many thankful players who saw good in loh kits.<br />
<br />
Nowadays , the kit is still one of the most known kits in 2bpe's history and are often scattered at warp meetup and warp pvp, and it shall be worshiped for good luck.<br />
    </p5>   
<br />
    -Prayers and sins
    <p6>
<br />
Daily prayers should be done in loh churches and temples to earn God's blessing<br />
<br />
The prayers : "God bless all of loh followers, God bless loh kit ,God bless Tim and Xiaosha for his kind gift"<br />
Dm nika#7899 for more info about where churches and temples are.<br />
<br />
not praying for a day or more will NOT result in any kind of punishment ,its just better if you do (its fine if you don't tho) .<br />
<br />
What makes this religion a special kind of religion (other than it being the only true one ofc) <br /> is that everyone is welcome to believe in it, no matter what their race,sexuality or gender is.<br />
<br />
The only three acts that are unacceptable are burning/greifing churches or temples of loh <br /> (if you fix the damage you've done your sins will be gone)and burning/getting rid of loh kits or loh bibles on purpose <br /> (You may be forgiven by god if you give 20 new players loh kits or give someone a copy of this bible)<br />
The third and last sin is greifing the innocent (stealing is fine tho).<br />
if you greif an innocent person that had done you no harm this will be considered a major sin <br /> to repent you have to apologize to the innocent and he  has to accept your apology otherwise it's a sin.<br />
or you can rebuild the damage you've done.<br />
<br />
and god will punish those who do not repent from their sins very strict punishments that shall not be specified.<br />
<br />
For more info about this great religion Dm Knuckles#2266 on discord<br />
And you are welcome to ask any question .<br />
<br />
Shall god be with you . <br />
<br />
Amen <br />
